Hi, I'm Joe. I'm a rightshifter and I currently work for the NHS within mental health.

On Metaphor 
===========

## Last year reference
* Last year I left with an Aristole quote on Systems Thinking.
* So as I way saying.
* The greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor – Aristotle

## Metaphor is powerful
 * harness the power of metaphors to persuade and inform
 * They make the complex simple and the controversial palatable.

## Metaphor educates. Metaphor Influences. 
 * Teach (greenhouse effect) any product/service can draw upon metaphor, 
 * Assist (transition from one tech to another, web pages from print media, files & folders). 
 * (Less obvious) Influence .If your product is unlike other, perhaps abstract, then make it tangible. (prudentail rock in logo shows security 'let us be yur rock'). 

## Metaphor constrains.
 * While it helps educate and understand, it also prompts us for points to think for analogies.
 * With a central metaphor added to a discpline like 'engineering' we search first and contrain ourselves to searching for explations and inspiriation from the metaphor of that domain. 
 * That got me thinking. Hod did we even get around to applying the engineering metaphor?

Engineering History
===================

## Cast your mind back to 1968
 * Apollo 8 sees the far side of the moon.
 * When you said 'Apple' people thought of Apple records 
 * C hasn't been invented. ALGOL and COBOL are the dominant languages with mathmaticians doing the bulk of the programming work.
 * Operating Systems were written in machine language. It was 4 years before Unix was written in C.
 * We are in the Software crisis (over budget, time, inefficient, low quality, did not meet requirements, difficult to maintain, never delivered)

## 1968, Garmisch, NATO
 * practitioners, acadademics (very reasonable) gather for the first conference on "Software Engineering", an offshoot from the NATO Computer Science group.
 * Disaapointment at the growing ranks of software devs in comparison with hardware.
 * Their estimates were poor. Pointed as a lack of a theoretical basis. Even worse, the programmers were making decisions!

## Wright Brothers quote
"We build systems like the Wright brothers built airplanes — build the whole thing, push it off the cliff, let it crash, and start over again."

## signoff
 * "The phrase ‘software engineering’ was deliberately chosen as being provocative. Time to grow up and become engineers instead of crofters and aspire to be industrialists.
 * There were no formal methods. So they copied from hardware, where it is prohibitivly expensive to change late.

The Engineering Metaphor
========================

## This is why we are called engineers, and we construct software
 * Two years after the 1968 conf, a man who worked at NASA published a paper called "Manging the dev of large software systems" the Waterfall paper was published, setting our industry on its new path
 * Heavily influenced from the desire to have a defined process model rather than an emperical one. Seen as more like engineering.

## Like engineering
 * Like Engineering, they wanted a division of labour. Analysts, Designers and Programmers.
 * Expensive people mitigate all the decisions, labourers do the small bits.
 * This idea is pervasive. In a lot of place we still work this way, offshoring from a functional spec to devs on mars. Artitects doing huge Visio designs that represent nothing like the reality the biz needs
 * Other ideas that came out of this was heavy documentation for handoffs. Royce says in his paper that he would fire any PMs without heavily documented processes and systems.

## It's our misconception
 * You may be detecting a general theme of misunderstanding engineering. 
 * There are many more models of engineering than strucural, where we focused. Chemical, Civil, Electrical, where they use more empirical methods.
 * Another thing they wanted in 1968 was mathematical models to prove software is correct. That's not their intention, they are used to reduce costs by not having to build a prototype, not for proving correctness. 

## Other effects
 * UML, attempts to mathematically define requirements. Over indulgence in design patterns. Desire to be Certified by a standards body. Academics are still chasing this theory goal with SEMAT.
 * Engineering was the first established metaphor for the way to build sofware in machine code, but now we need to revisit the assumptions that it was based off

## Primary Reason: The assumptions that we are are engineering practice were wrong
 * Some assumpions were never valid (all engineering is like structural engin, programming is like building, mathematical analysis is about correctness, rather than controlling costs, A silver bullet)
 * The problem is the assumptions from 1968 are no longer valid (we don't use machine code per machine. code hard to read, change, testing is expensive, deployment meanst installation at the customer site)
 * The parts of software that now cost are no longer the same as engineering, we have different problems, and require a different metaphor

The Cultivation Metaphor
========================

## Cultivation
 * A few other metaphors have been suggested: art, music, craft, pottery, Grace Hopper said it's like planning dinner.. I suggest something a little more down to earth.
 * Software development isn't a mechanical beast, it's organic in it's nature.
 * Developers are more like gardeners (growing OO systems, prune undesirable wayward bits, sometimes removing a big bit the architect put in)
 * Managers are more like farmers. (they shoudn't try to perfectly predict the future, just create the conditions that things will flourish). (gag: factory farming)

## A Richer ground for metaphors
 * Refactoring is like pruning
 * Bugs (destroy your hard work)
 * Slack time, leaving a field farrow (where is engineering, 100% resource utilization, fractions of a person)
 * Sustainable gardening (design, construction, and maintenance practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs)

## Project Gardening
 * Thought assembly line, very linear and batch like assembly.
 * Adrian mentioned Single Piece Flow, which I combined with Impact Mapping to create a Project Garden
 * Simply a goal in the middle, which expands and contracts
 * Freedom from what is a story, task. Shows you the risks to be mitigated (rather than in a risk log)
 * A lot of agile is just mini-waterfall, this non-linear approach provides an escape from that thinking.

Finish

Metaphor Educates, Influences, Constrains

Engineering might of been a useful metaphor at one point, but it isn't today. I want you to think in cultivation. Cultivate your code, cultivate your product and grow your people.

So I think we have to change metaphors. We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of sofware, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching. We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture. We have to recognize that software development is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of it. All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish.

We can't as Artistole suggests, all be masters of metaphor, but we can change the metaphor which rules our working lives.

Thank you.
